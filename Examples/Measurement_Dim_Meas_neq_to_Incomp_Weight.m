%This allows on to lead the counter-example proving that the dimension
%measure of a set of measurements is NOT equal the incompatibility weight;
%i.e. in general the maximisation over input state rho is not achieved by
%the maximally mixed state.

%This is a qubit example, so both the dimension measure, and
%incompatibility weight can be calculated exactly.

%To see this, run 
%measurement_dim_meas ( the dimension measure)
%and
%measurement_incomp_weight ( the incompatibility weight)
% on the below set of measurements (a pair of qubit POVMs)

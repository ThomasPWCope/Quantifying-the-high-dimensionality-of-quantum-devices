This MATLAB accompanies the paper 
"Quantifying the high-dimensionality of quantum devices"
arXiv: https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.05722

It has the following folders:

Examples: Useful measurement/steering assemblages and channels to highlight key properties of the
Schmidt and dimension measures.

MUB_Only: Functions related to our conjecture on MUBs.

SDP_Bounds_On_Measures: exact values or upper bounds for the measures, calculated via SDP.

Twirling: Functions implementing the unitary-relabelling which defines a noisy MUB pair in prime
dimension.

Useful_Objects: Some Useful assemblages for studying the dimension measure.

Requires cvx and QETLAB to run, along with possibly Matlab's discrete fourier transform , which is
not included in the base build.
